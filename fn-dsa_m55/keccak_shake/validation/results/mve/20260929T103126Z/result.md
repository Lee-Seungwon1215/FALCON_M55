# Keccak cycle baseline (M55)

Run: `20260929T103126Z`. ELF SHA-256: `22e64f4016830294428f0eabdd0cc23af49007b3b4c66af888b8ac1e8560dce4`.

100 samples; each sample contains 64 calls; 5 warm-up batches. The empty-loop/timer cost is subtracted, retaining BL/return and the actual function body.

The split/merge groups are measured as the matching private-call sequence in a separate harness. They exclude caller-side state loads/stores; they are not exact in-situ exclusive portions of the process_block time. process_block includes its own split/merge work already. Do not add the three group totals.

Correctness: helper cases 5120, full-state comparisons 1024, SHAKE256 vectors 7, guards PASS. CFSR/HFSR/AFSR = 0.
These tests and any absence of observed timing differences are not a proof of constant-time behavior.

Empty harness cycles per iteration: process_empty=3.984375, helper_empty=3.015625.

| Timing class (raw single call) | Count | Mean | Min | Max |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 (0=zero, 1=random) | 1000 | 12572.000000 | 12572 | 12572 |
| 1 (0=zero, 1=random) | 1000 | 12572.000000 | 12572 | 12572 |

Welch t = None (undefined: both observed sample variances are zero). Limited two-class timing check, not a formal proof.
